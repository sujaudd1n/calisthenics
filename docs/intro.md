# Getting Started

Hello. Let's get started. At the beginning nothing matters. You don't 
have to follow rules, diet or any kind of discipline.

Just watch these videos and do whatever exercise and whenever you can.

- [Calisthenics for Beginners | In Depth Step-by-Step Guide to Building Strength and Muscle - Leo Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vczr0WuYK9g)
- [How I Built Muscle At Home (Without Weights) - Colin Murray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho8fvPH_Ro0)

Now get disciplined if you want.
